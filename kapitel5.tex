    \section{Compare your model's performance with other approaches in the literature}

        We compared our model's performance with other state-of-the-art approaches in image segmentation/localization.
        Our model achieved comparable or better results on the XYZ dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.

    \section{Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model and the tradeoffs between different CNN architectures and training strategies}

        Our model is a simple CNN architecture that achieved good performance on the XYZ dataset.
        However, more complex architectures, such as U-Net and Mask R-CNN, may perform better on more challenging datasets.
        The choice of hyperparameters and training strategies can also have a significant impact on the model's performance.
