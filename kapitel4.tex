    \section{Present the results of your experiments, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall}

        Our model achieved an accuracy of X%, a precision of Y%, and a recall of Z% on the test set.
        We also computed other metrics, such as F1 score and intersection over union (IoU), to evaluate the model's performance.

    \section{Analyze the impact of different hyperparameters and training strategies on performance}

        We found that changing the learning rate and batch size had a significant impact on performance.
        We also observed that adding dropout regularization improved the model's generalization ability.

    \section{Visualize the output of your model and provide insights into its behavior}

        We visualized the segmentation masks produced by our model and compared them with the ground truth masks.
        We observed that our model was able to accurately segment objects in the image, but struggled with small and complex shapes.
        We also visualized the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers to gain insights into how the model was extracting features from the images.
