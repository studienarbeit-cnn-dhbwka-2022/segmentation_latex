    \section{Describe the dataset you used to train your model and the preprocessing steps you applied}

        We used the XYZ dataset, which contains X images of size YxZ.
        We applied normalization and data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's performance.

    \section{Explain the architecture of your CNN model and the hyperparameters you selected}

        Our CNN model has X convolutional layers, Y pooling layers, and Z fully connected layers.
        We experimented with different hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to find the optimal settings.

    \section{Discuss the training process and any modifications you made to improve performance}

        We used the Adam optimizer and the binary cross-entropy loss function to train our model.
        We experimented with different modifications, including dropout regularization and changing the number of filters in the convolutional layers, to improve performance.
